Hey, what's up? ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manthan, a kickass MERN stack developer rocking skills like ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and Agile development. I'm all about crafting jaw-dropping web applications that blow minds and keep users hooked.

But wait, there's more! I've got this burning passion for merging artificial intelligence with web dev. It's like combining magic and code to build intelligent apps that'll make your jaw drop. Oh, and I'm all about that DevOps life too. I'm on a mission to make the software development journey as smooth as butter, from deployment to maintenance.

Hit me up if you're ready to join forces on an epic coding adventure. Or if you just wanna chat tech and geek out, I'm down for that too! Reach me at manthanindane141@gmail.com, and let's create some digital awesomeness together!
