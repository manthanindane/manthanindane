Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manthan, a skilled MERN stack developer. I work with technologies like ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub. Crafting user-friendly web applications is my jam â€“ making tech both functional and beautiful.

But that's not all! I've got a passion for bringing AI into the mix. Imagine coding magic to build smart apps that users love. Currently, I'm exploring the exciting world of machine learning, especially into NLP. Curious about tech trends like LLM, Langchain, and RAGS too!
